The Business-Psychological Assessment System utilizes psychological assessment tools to identify and solve issues related to workplace psychology. This system is specifically designed for corporate human resources departments seeking effective solutions for their teams.

## Key Features

Built using Python/Flask/JS and MySQL technologies, this system offers a range of features to help teams maximize their potential:

- Logging in via a Google account
- Free use of the offered psychological diagnostic instruments


## Getting Started

Getting started with the Business-Psychometric Assessment System is easy. Simply log in using your Google account and gain access to a wide range of psychological diagnostic instruments for free. With this system, you can gain deep insights into employee behavior, motivation, and areas for development, all with the aim of improving team dynamics and productivity.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from users who have experience with work psychology assessment tools. If you hold a license for a proven-effective instrument, or if the instrument is free to use. You can also contribute to this project by providing feedback and insights to help us improve our offerings.

## Known Issues and Limitations

Please note that the Business-Psychometric Assessment System is in its initial development phase and is currently limited to the psychological instrument for job satisfaction assessment (specifically its diagnostic part), MBTI personality test and PCL-R Psychopathy Checklist (revised). We are continuously working to expand our offerings and improve the system, and welcome your feedback and suggestions. 
Please be aware that the Alpha version of our application currently offers the diagnostic portion of our tests, with a minimal interpretation. We are actively working on expanding our offerings and enhancing the system.
